## Disclaimer
This Bicep example is designed solely for development purposes. It offers a quick and convenient way to spin up an AKS cluster for development and testing environments. However, please be aware that this example does not include configurations and practices essential for an enterprise-grade AKS deployment.

For those seeking a more production-ready solution, the Terraform example is better aligned with production standards.
